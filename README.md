# recursiveboatloading
Common "Ferry Loading Problem" was solved using memoization and backtracking. 
Using recursion, the code was able to backtrack over all the possible loading orders. 
Memoization was used to ensure equivalent cases were not repeated. A two dimensional 
boolean array and a hashtable with custom hash functions were created to store the 
visited cases. The efficiency of the data structures were compared in the report.
